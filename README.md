## 👋 Hi, I’m Jeongho Chae from South Korea

- I am an undergraduate student at Korea University, double majoring in Life Sciences and Computer Science and Engineering. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of applying computational approaches to biology.
- Also, I'm an ultra-cyclist who loves sports, especially cycling. I once biked across South Korea on a 400 mile national tour. During my mandatory military service, I dedicated myself to fitness and successfully gained 17kg through consistent exercise. I believe that perseverance, hard work, and unwavering commitment can help achieve any goal.
