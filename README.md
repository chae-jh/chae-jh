## 👋 Hi, I’m **Jeongho Chae**  
**Undergraduate Researcher @ UNC Chapel Hill (Furey Lab)**  


## 🔬 Research Interests
I work at the intersection of **computational biology** and **translational research**, with a focus on:

- Chromatin accessibility, regulatory genomics, and ATAC-seq–based profiling  
- Statistical & algorithmic methods for cell-type deconvolution  
- Wavelet-based feature extraction and denoising for biological signals  
- Translational applications in immune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., IBD)  
- (Interest) Machine learning and AI-based approaches for biological inference  


## 📝 Publications

## 🚴‍♂️ Outside of Research
I’m also an **ultra-cyclist** — I biked 400 miles across South Korea on a solo cycling expedition.  
During military service, I gained 17 kg through consistent training and eventually **ranked 1st out of 400 soldiers** in the physical fitness test.
I believe in **persistence, discipline, and incremental progress** in research and in life.
